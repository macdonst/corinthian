        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Not unlike rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_leather">Corinthian Leather</a> the Corinthian 
project aims to provide more advanced UI elements for applications built with 
<a href="https://incubator.apache.org/cordova/">Apache Cordova</a>. Initially Cordova will target the Android platform 
but as time goes own we'll add support for other platforms. </p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>We think Apache Cordova is great but there are some things that it doesn't address as they are outside of it's 
bailiwick. One of those items is a rich UI. Sometimes building Apache Cordova applications is more difficult than it 
could be as it doesn't (nor shouldn't) provide UI components. The philosophy of the Corinthian project is to provide 
some of these UI components like contact and file pickers as well as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a> the &lt;audio/&gt; and &lt;video/&gt; tags 
so you won't have to change your HTML code when porting your application to Android.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p><b>Update 2012/08/28:</b> So I have not had as much time to work on this project as I would have hoped but things have 
  continued to progress regardless. First with regards to the audio tag support I had to fix a number of bugs in the PhoneGap 
  Media API for the 2.0.0 release. On the video tag, I'm working with Steren Giannini to pull in some of his changes to 
  the Android repo to have an embedded video player. For the ContactPicker, expect this to become part of core for the 2.2 
  release.
</p>

<p>Right now the target is Android but over time we'll migrate these native Android UI components into JavaScript so 
that it will be compatible with other platforms. </p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Things will get easier soon but for now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <b>`ant jar`</b></li>
<li>Copy the corinthian-0.1.0.jar file to your Android project's lib directory</li>
<li>Copy the assets/www/corinthian.js to your Android projects assets/www directory</li>
<li>Add the following lines to your res/xml/plugins.xml file:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
&lt;plugin name="FileDialog" value="com.simonmacdonald.corinthian.FileDialog"/&gt;
&lt;plugin name="ContactPicker" value="com.simonmacdonald.corinthian.ContactPicker"/&gt;
&lt;plugin name="VideoPlayer" value="com.simonmacdonald.corinthian.VideoPlayer"/&gt;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Finally link the corinthian.js file in your HTML file using the script tag.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="corinthian.js"/&gt;
</pre>
